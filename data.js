    "role": "Editorial Assistant",
    "content": ["I worked at this company for close to two years. I mainly quit because of two reasons. First, I was making 45K as an editorial assistant. We are told that in publishing this is standard, and yet with HaperCollins offices being in New York and San Francisco, it is tough to survive in thesecities with that income. Meanwhile, editorial assistants have to juggle so much–given a book, they are assigned duties in editing, marketing, copyediting, design, financial projection analysis…even acting as a personal secretary for your editors at times (I cannot count the times I had to book stuff for my managers and log in their company card expenses..).", 
 "By the end of my time at this company, they were dangling the possibility of a promotion (a meager 5K increase) to me and other editorial assistants, but the promotion kept getting delayed, and I ultimately felt like this is not the right job for my financial stability and career growth. There is a running joke among the employees that in order to work at HarperCollins long enough to make it to senior editor positions, you’ll need a spouse who actually makes a decent income.", 
  "Second, the managerial system works well in some cases but in my case, I worked under a manager who was a very privileged white woman. I constantly felt microaggressions during my time working there. Just because I was a BIPOC, three white managers would ask for my input on how to sell any book that mentions BIPOC without offending anyone and alienating the “larger audience.” The Black senior editor of Amistad (one of the Harpers imprints) was fired with no warning–this is very much indicative of what HarperCollins is: an unhealthy workplace for people from marginalized communities that at best practices performative allyship on the backs of its POC employees. It is an open secret that the current president and the execs are transphobic and extremely insensitive to racial issues. The anecdotes are overwhelming. I heard from other editorial assistants that a senior POC editor talked to them about how she doesn’t feel comfortable bringing in other POC women to HarperCollins because it is not a safe place.",
  "I love publishing in general and have grown various skills during my time at HarperCollins, but it was fruitless working for a company that truly does not care about you, especially if you are BIPOC. No love for books can justify these working conditions.",
"It’s been more than 40 days since the strike in NY. But HarperCollins is not doing anything but post managerial temporary jobs so that they won’t be covered by the union. This response really sums up the culture at HarperCollins."

    "company": "Genentech",
    "role": "Rotational Engineer",
  "content": ["Context:",
  "I worked at Genentech for a little over 2 years. 2 years in a full time capacity and a few months in a part time capacity. I was lucky enough to be a part of the rotational program Process Development Rotational Program (PDRP) which is a series of 4-6 month rotations across 2 years. It’s Genentech’s traditional new hire path to employment; there are various other rotational programs on their website.",
  "About PDRP and rotational programs:",
  "The rotational programs typically start right after your undergrad or masters. PDRP, one of those programs, was traditionally for computation/computational bio people but I was part of the first digital cohort. It’s given me a lot of insight into how the company operates across different areas. I really enjoyed being able to grow and learn in many different fields instead of being stuck on one project.", 
  "2 out of 3 rotations were software engineering/full-stack development and one of them was in AR development, building immersive training for complex bioreactors. The first rotation is determined based on your resume, but on our next three rotations we get to indicate our preferences. A lot of the alums of the program go work full-time at Genentech or go work at other biotech companies.",
"As part of this rotational program, we get technical mentors for every rotation who lead and design the project. Sometimes if you are a digital associate, you get a software mentor who understands software goals as well. We also have an overarching mentor for the program who we check in biweekly.",
"The pandemic and remote work impacted the social events for the cohort but usually the cohort gets really close and there is funding for events and bonding activities.",
"Company Culture:",
"The culture of the company is incredible. I’ve been doing a masters part time during the entirety of the full time rotation. I asked if I can focus on my masters full time. They actually let me do that. They let me work at 10% capacity (4hrs/week), which I had never heard of any company supporting some plan like that. They were happy to let me focus on learning through my masters and then return to Genentech. So that really showed that the company valued employee growth.",
"Advice for applicants interested in Genentech and its rotational programs:",
"Overall, I highly recommend Genentech–I had a great experience so far and if you are interested in biotech generally, it’s great to have Genentech on your resume because everyone knows Genentech in this industry. For biotech it’s hard to develop a universal skill set that will work for every interview. For software engineers, it’s the typical leet code, cracking the technical interview so on and so forth. So, during the Genentech interview, what usually happens is they will use the resume as a guide and probe deeper into how strong you are on those things you mentioned. But since there is a strong incentive for bringing more software talent to Genentech, if you demonstrate some additional data science, engineering skills, even as a bio person, it’ll give you a leg up.",
"My advice for people who are interested in this program is that they intern at Genentech first. Large portion of this cohort have been previous interns. It definitely helps. Apply to the internship earlier on in your college career."]
