    "content": ["I worked at this company for close to two years. I mainly quit because of two reasons. First, I was making 45K as an editorial assistant. We are told that in publishing this is standard, and yet with HaperCollins offices being in New York and San Francisco, it is tough to survive in thesecities with that income. Meanwhile, editorial assistants have to juggle so much–given a book, they are assigned duties in editing, marketing, copyediting, design, financial projection analysis…even acting as a personal secretary for your editors at times (I cannot count the times I had to book stuff for my managers and log in their company card expenses..).", 
 "By the end of my time at this company, they were dangling the possibility of a promotion (a meager 5K increase) to me and other editorial assistants, but the promotion kept getting delayed, and I ultimately felt like this is not the right job for my financial stability and career growth. There is a running joke among the employees that in order to work at HarperCollins long enough to make it to senior editor positions, you’ll need a spouse who actually makes a decent income.", 
  "Second, the managerial system works well in some cases but in my case, I worked under a manager who was a very privileged white woman. I constantly felt microaggressions during my time working there. Just because I was a BIPOC, three white managers would ask for my input on how to sell any book that mentions BIPOC without offending anyone and alienating the “larger audience.” The Black senior editor of Amistad (one of the Harpers imprints) was fired with no warning–this is very much indicative of what HarperCollins is: an unhealthy workplace for people from marginalized communities that at best practices performative allyship on the backs of its POC employees. It is an open secret that the current president and the execs are transphobic and extremely insensitive to racial issues. The anecdotes are overwhelming. I heard from other editorial assistants that a senior POC editor talked to them about how she doesn’t feel comfortable bringing in other POC women to HarperCollins because it is not a safe place.",
  "I love publishing in general and have grown various skills during my time at HarperCollins, but it was fruitless working for a company that truly does not care about you, especially if you are BIPOC. No love for books can justify these working conditions.",
"It’s been more than 40 days since the strike in NY. But HarperCollins is not doing anything but post managerial temporary jobs so that they won’t be covered by the union. This response really sums up the culture at HarperCollins."
